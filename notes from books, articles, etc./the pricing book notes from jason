common methods of pricing

1. industry standard
2. cost-plus
3. opportunity cost

industry standard
- known as market rate. this means your rate lines up with everyone else’s
- market rates work against you, unless your at the bottom of the pile
- penetration pricing: setting cheaper rates than your competitors and hoping you get more work to accommodate the price drop
- penetration pricing is difficult to lean on since you assume you’re the worst of the bunch. if you get more experience, your price increases

cost plus
- one calculates the expenses every month, then adds a percentage on top in order to gain profit. one then sets the goal for the total amount, and plans to make that amount in one month
- for the profit margin, most agencies go for 15%-50%
- cost plus is fairly simple
- the big downside is that when working with clients you have to be flexible with costs. setting a rate before you meet your first customer is terrible, since if the client can’t afford you you will have to adjust the cost plus and eat profits.

opportunity cost
- in essence, what are you willing to give up in order to what you get in return
- can’t be derived from a formula

Rates
- you can choose from fixed rate to time based rates.
- there is also blended hourly rate
- to calculate blended hourly rate you can either
    - average your rates: get all developers rates and average them out. if you have two developers charging $100 an hour, then the rate the agency would offer is $200.
    - use past experience, aka look at previous project and calculate based on hours set
- some agencies have rate cards which shows a card listing the rate for each role involved in a project
- tying your revenue to your effort is terrible
- beyond hourly rates there are daily, weekly, or monthly rates but they all suffer from the same major setback of tying your revenue to your effort
- people like knowing the price of an item or service before they commit to purchasing it
- best transactions must be beneficial to seller and the buyer
- When you tell a client that you have an hourly rate, they compare you with all the other people they know to have hourly rates.
- framing sales through hourly rates makes value comparison easy for a client. some clients think your work is easier than expected for example
- hourly rate is misaligned in incentives because although the more work you do and the more money you get, the client loses out because they are literally losing money
- we all have the same amount of time, it’s not a dif- ferentiator for anyone.
- The combined limitations of time and rates make for ine ective variables in raising your income.
- Fixed prices appeal because they appear to solve the plight of experienced designers who zip to a project’s nish. Unfor- tunately, the methodology to derive a xed price is often based on an hourly price, a line of reasoning that sinks you from the start.
- fixed prices are fundamentally based on hourly rates
- to help give leverage to developers/designers using fixed prices, workers will either lie and pad their fixed price, or raise their hourly rate, both unrealistic.
- Price is one of the most powerful tools you have in a project conversation
- to solve these issues: Spend the time with your customer to learn about where they need to go, and why. If you can understand their desire for the destination, you can put together a few packages that get them excited about where they’ll soon be—and make you rich at the same time.

Valued Based Pricing
- You need to have something they value.
- the more value you create, the more you increase your customer’s profit as well as your own
- the combination of your profit and your customer’s profit is called value
- value is what makes our work succeed
- your job as a service provider is to create as much value as possible for your customers
- the backbone of value based pricing is making their business better
- the more profit(in other words value) you can create for them, the more of that profit you’re entitled to
- to ensure you can do pull this off, you must understand how valuable you are and what you value
    - your value: what is your/agencys value
        - price the customer, not the product. what one website costs for one person may cost quadruple for another company
        - another question you ask is, how badly do i need the work.
        - not only do you price the customer, you price the moment(are you booked or desperately need work)
    - object value pricing: try this tactic. next time a project comes your way. ask yourself how much would you trade this for. a new laptop, car, house?
    - changes: your value changes over time
        - your largest value is your ability to walk away from a prospect.
        - obviously if you need work, your price is less, if you’re booked then you can charge more
        - being able to tailor each price to your value and what your client values is the beauty of value pricing
- price the customer, not the service. how badly do they need it and right now?
- charging more for speed, and even tolerance of dealing with client is apart of value pricing
- things like friendliness, integrity, dependability, convenience, image, service, innovation, and knowledgeable salespeople. these are things you should put a price on.
- once finding a prospective client, here is the following questionnaire you can use to get answers to help you value the project
    - What’s the timeframe? Does a certain event depend on this project launching?
        - Look out for customers who manufacture false urgency.
    - What are you looking for from us? Do you want us to design, build, and launch the whole site? Or do you have developers or other partners lined up and only need us for design?
        - Are they asking for six months’ worth of work but only giving you six weeks to do it? That can show you how much your customer actually knows about the work they want.
    - Have you already started on any part of the project? Do you have existing work? A new logo? Some rough designs or ideas for the site?
        - If the client already has a ton of wireframes and documentation, they may be looking for someone who can execute without ques- tions instead of someone who can re ne their vision. I’m wary of situations like this, because it becomes difficult to provide real value—and charge for it.
        - get a view of your customer’s complete ecosystem of partners before proceeding.
        - sometimes an agency doesn’t know what they want, and finding out if they worked with other agencies and fired them because the scope was too much or the agency was too much of a pain. be aware of this.
    - How large is your team? What are the roles you envision on your end?
        - if a company is not focusing a large part of their team to the project, then its probable they care little about the project and am not willing to spend a lot on it
        - Large companies are especially notorious for starting projects and not paying proper attention to them, leading to project pauses and ultimately stagnation.
        - sometimes you need to request certain roles from the client on a project to ensure the project is complete because of communication, etc.
        - if you’re working with a customer who is a pain in the butt client, don’t forget to add an extra surcharge
        -
    - How did you hear about our work? What speci cally interests you about it? Any projects you’re keen on?
        - this is a basic weed-out question. if they don’t know you,   cut them off. that client will be eating your time.
        - keep an eye out for buzz words or generic terms. those buzz words can let you know that the customer hasn’t spent much time with your work or reveal what’s important to them as an end result
        -
    - How much money have you set aside for this project?
        - don’t ever use the word budget, use the word ‘money.’
        - ALWAYS ask this question
        - focusing on ‘money’ keeps the conversation on maximum value, whereas ‘budget’ draws attention to minimum spending
        - its generally best to ask this question about three-quarters of the way through, after you’ve asked them a simple question
        - treat this with a straight-coward attitude
        - if the client asks you how much you think it will cost, then you should ask “Are you aiming to spend closer to $500K, $50K, or $5K?”
    - Are you talking to other companies about this project? Might we ask how many? What do you like about their work?
        - if the customer is talking to 20 other clients, then don’t pursue them. the odds aren’t in your favor.
    - Anything else we should know about?
        - if you can’t hangout, then why bother with them
        - this is the last opportunity to make an impression

- The magic in pricing is when you can match what your customer values with how valuable you are.
- The balance of value is what makes for the most productive relationships; iron, after all, sharpens iron. 
A Pricing Case Study

- a few things to keep in mind when talking with a potential client
    - I’m being honest. It’s the best way to start any conversation or relationship.
    - I’m reminding Mega Agency that we’re different. Presumably, they contacted us because we stood out from the crowd.
    - I’m establishing our ability to walk away. I don’t need their work right now, so I’m looking for a reason to want it.
- my go-to pricing framework is Goldilocks pricing: you offer three options (often tiered).
    - this method is effective because
        - it employs the anchoring effect: when you up the price of the first item, then subsequently charge less for other products, users are more likely to choose the latter products, considering it a deal
        - three options enable you to create your own framing and let you control the dynamic
        - it forces you to think critically about different ways you can create value for your client. exploring these options can lead you to unearth ideas you or your client may not have dreamed of otherwise.
    - in brainstorming your options, the biggest mistake you can make at this stage is focusing on what type of deliverables you can create. you want to price on value to the client, which means you’re selling results, not deliverables.
    - Most consultants place their value proposition at the wrong end of the equation: they focus on their ability to do rather than on the client’s ability to improve.
    - when pricing options, you base each one on a different trait or result thats important to the client. then, you sort them into tiers: high value, medium value, and low value
    - if the client doesn’t give you a price, that’s ok. it gives you the opportunity to focus solely on the value you can provide in each of your options, rather than trying to come in at a number your client (maybe unrealistically) conjured.
- I don’t have any specific science on picking 10%, but I’ve found that around a tenth of the total potential bounty is both small enough for the client to consider a worthy investment and large enough to be lucrative for me.
- Customers aren’t directly interested in deliverables; they’re interested in what those deliverables can do for them and their customers
- when naming options, you might find that setting option names based on the business the client is helpful. it provides an emotional hook
- You want your client to focus on the value, on the results. Everyone you’re pitching against likely sent one quote (unless they read this book before you); you sent three. You’re presenting them with three unique ways you could help.
- focusing on value scales better than any other method you can come up with.
- make sure you’re clear about what you’re o ering and, whenever possible, walk your customer through their options on the phone or in person, never solely through email. 

Value Pricing: What To Expect
- Since I’ve started using value pricing, my loss rate on proposals has gone way up—my agency lands significantly fewer projects than when we had a standard hourly rate.
- Value pricing is scary, both for you as the provider and for the customer. It requires trust on both sides. It’s risky for both parties.
- even if the client says no to your offer, you’re building a relationship with that person.
- Be as intentional about your pricing as you are with your design process, your github repo, the clothes you wear to that meeting, etc.
